      Bees are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants, known for their role in pollination and, in the case of
      the best-known bee species, the western honey bee, for producing honey and beeswax. Bees are a monophyletic
      lineage within the superfamily Apoidea and are presently considered a clade, called Anthophila. There are over
      16,000 known species of bees in seven recognized biological families.[1][2] They are found on every continent
      except Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants.

      Some species — including honey bees, bumblebees, and stingless bees — live socially in colonies. Bees are adapted
      for feeding on nectar and pollen, the former primarily as an energy source and the latter primarily for protein
      and other nutrients. Most pollen is used as food for larvae. Bee pollination is important both ecologically and
      commercially. The decline in wild bees has increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives of
      honey bees.

      <br><br><br><br><br><br>


      Bees range in size from tiny stingless bee species whose workers are less than 2 millimetres (0.08 in) long, to
      Megachile pluto, the largest species of leafcutter bee, whose females can attain a length of 39 millimetres (1.54
      in). The most common bees in the Northern Hemisphere are the Halictidae, or sweat bees, but they are small and
      often mistaken for wasps or flies. Vertebrate predators of bees include birds such as bee-eaters; insect predators
      include beewolves and dragonflies.

      Human beekeeping or apiculture has been practised for millennia, since at least the times of Ancient Egypt and
      Ancient Greece. Apart from honey and pollination, honey bees produce beeswax, royal jelly and propolis. Bees have
      appeared in mythology and folklore, through all phases of art and literature, from ancient times to the present
      day, though primarily focused in the Northern Hemisphere, where beekeeping is far more common.
      <br><br>
      The analysis of 353 wild bee and hoverfly species across Britain from 1980 to 2013 found the insects have been
      lost from a quarter of the places they inhabited in 1980.[3]
      The ancestors of bees were wasps in the family Crabronidae, which were predators of other insects. The switch from
      insect prey to pollen may have resulted from the consumption of prey insects which were flower visitors and were
      partially covered with pollen when they were fed to the wasp larvae. This same evolutionary scenario may have
      occurred within the vespoid wasps, where the pollen wasps evolved from predatory ancestors. Until recently, the
      oldest non-compression bee fossil had been found in New Jersey amber, Cretotrigona prisca of Cretaceous age, a
      corbiculate bee.[4] A bee fossil from the early Cretaceous (~100 mya), Melittosphex burmensis, is considered "an
      extinct lineage of pollen-collecting Apoidea sister to the modern bees".[5] Derived features of its morphology
      (apomorphies) place it clearly within the bees, but it retains two unmodified ancestral traits (plesiomorphies) of
      the legs (two mid-tibial spurs, and a slender hind basitarsus), showing its transitional status.[5] By the Eocene
      (~45 mya) there was already considerable diversity among eusocial bee lineages.[6][a]

      The highly eusocial corbiculate Apidae appeared roughly 87 Mya, and the Allodapini (within the Apidae) around 53
      Mya.[9] The Colletidae appear as fossils only from the late Oligocene (~25 Mya) to early Miocene.[10] The
      Melittidae are known from Palaeomacropis eocenicus in the Early Eocene.[11] The Megachilidae are known from trace
      fossils (characteristic leaf cuttings) from the Middle Eocene.[12] The Andrenidae are known from the
      Eocene-Oligocene boundary, around 34 Mya, of the Florissant shale.[13] The Halictidae first appear in the Early
      Eocene[14] with species[15][16] found in amber. The Stenotritidae are known from fossil brood cells of Pleistocene
      age.[17]
      <br><br><br>
      The earliest animal-pollinated flowers were shallow, cup-shaped blooms pollinated by insects such as beetles, so
      the syndrome of insect pollination was well established before the first appearance of bees. The novelty is that
      bees are specialized as pollination agents, with behavioral and physical modifications that specifically enhance
      pollination, and are the most efficient pollinating insects. In a process of coevolution, flowers developed floral
      rewards[18] such as nectar and longer tubes, and bees developed longer tongues to extract the nectar.[19] Bees
      also developed structures known as scopal hairs and pollen baskets to collect and carry pollen. The location and
      type differ among and between groups of bees. Most species have scopal hairs on their hind legs or on the
      underside of their abdomens. Some species in the family Apidae have pollen baskets on their hind legs, while very
      few lack these and instead collect pollen in their crops.[2] The appearance of these structures drove the adaptive
      radiation of the angiosperms, and, in turn, bees themselves.[7] Bees coevolved not only with flowers but it is
      believed that some species coevolved with mites. Some provide tufts of hairs called acarinaria that appear to
      provide lodgings for mites; in return, it is believed that mites eat fungi that attack pollen, so the relationship
      in this case may be mutualistc.[20][21]
